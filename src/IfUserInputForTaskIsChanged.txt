add 1/1/1111, 0000, 0001, title, description, priority, category

add 31/1/1111 0000 0000 title, description, priority, category

Provided that the format for date, starting time and ending time are kept the same.

title, description, priority and category each can have more than one word

What symbol should the separating character/symbol "," (comma) be replaced by?

Are the number of separating symbols to be fixed?

Do all 7 variables still need to be there?

If the Task's format is changed, the following classes need to have their code edited:

1) Task.java, for how the variables are extracted from the user input,
and the format for printTask() and getPrintTaskString()

2) CRUD.java, for addTask(), deleteTask(), changeTaskVariable() and undo()

3) Flex.java, for readAndExecuteCommand();

4) Checker.java (because it needs to use checkTask())


Checker.java, for checkTask()

If the Task's format is changed, the following classes do NOT need to have their code edited:

1) LastAction.java (has a Task.java object, and LastAction.java only needs to get or change the Task.java object)

2) FlexWindow.java (does not need to be aware of Task.java)

3) SortAndShow.java (because it only uses checkDate() from Checker.java)

4) ShowDays.java (because it only uses checkDate() from Checker.java)
